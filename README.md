# Libft - C Library

 Libft is a C library projects that includes replicas of some standart library functions in C and some additional ones that I myself coded.  
 I use this library in most of my C projects.

 ## Usage
 `make` to compile the library (libft.a)  
 `make bonus` to compile the library with bonus functions

 ## Functions

Each function in the library is prefixed with 'ft_' and named to mirror the function it replicates.
